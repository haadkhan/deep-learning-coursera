In this course, you will: 
* Understand how to diagnose errors in a machine learning system, and 
* Be able to prioritize the most promising directions for reducing error
* Understand complex ML settings, such as mismatched training/test sets, and comparing to and/or surpassing human-level performance
* Know how to apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning
