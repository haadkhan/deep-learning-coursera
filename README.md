# Deep Learning Specialization - Coursera

**Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI**

[Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning "Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera") is a Deep Learning MOOC series available on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/ "Coursera - Online Courses and Credentials From Top Educators."). 

[This repository](https://github.com/ngshya/deep-learning-coursera "Deep Learning - GiHub repository") contains course materials (slides, papers and some exercises) only for **reference purpose**. Most of the materials present in this repository are from the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning "Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera") and therefore created by the [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/ "deeplearning.ai team") team. These materials, already freely available on the specialization official site, are just reorganized in a tidy list format inside this repository and, possibly, enriched with reference papers and/or sample scripts. 

In respect of the [Coursera Honor Code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code "Coursera Honor Code"), quizzes and assignments solutions are password protected inside zip folders and not available publicly.
